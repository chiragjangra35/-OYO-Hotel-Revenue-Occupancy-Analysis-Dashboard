**🏨 OYO Hotel Revenue & Occupancy Analysis Dashboard**

**📝 Executive Summary**
This project analyzes the revenue and operational performance of OYO Hotels. Using historical booking data, I created a dashboard to monitor key hospitality metrics such as RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), and Occupancy %.

The analysis provides actionable insights into pricing strategies, revealing a significant gap between weekday and weekend revenues and highlighting high cancellation rates (25%) as a major area for improvement.

**💼 Business Problem**
The hospitality industry relies heavily on Revenue Management—selling the right room to the right customer at the right price. The stakeholders needed to answer:

Are we maximizing our revenue potential (RevPAR)?

Which cities and property types are driving the most revenue?

Why is the cancellation rate high, and how does it impact the bottom line?

**🛠️ Tools & Techniques**
**Data Visualization:** Power BI
**Domain Knowledge:** Hospitality Metrics (RevPAR, ADR, DSRN, Realisation %)
**Data Processing:** Data Cleaning, Modeling, and KPI calculation.

**📊 Key Metrics Explained (KPIs)**
To ensure business alignment, the following KPIs were calculated:

**RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): 7,337.** (The most important metric for hotel efficiency).

**ADR (Average Daily Rate): 12,696.** (The average price sold per room).

**Occupancy %: 57.79%.** (Percentage of rooms occupied).

**Realisation %: 70.14%.** (Successful check-ins / Total bookings).

**🔍 Key Insights & Analysis**
**1. Revenue Trends: The Weekend Surge**
**Trend:** There is a consistent spike in revenue during weekends.

**Insight:** "Business" category hotels (which make up 61% of revenue) are likely seeing luxury travel.

**Strategy:** Implement Dynamic Pricing—increase room rates slightly on weekends to capitalize on high demand, and offer "Business Packages" on weekdays to boost low weekday occupancy.

**2. Location Performance**
**Top Performer:** Mumbai generates the highest revenue (0.66bn), despite not having the highest occupancy. This suggests Mumbai has a higher Average Daily Rate (ADR).

**Area of Concern:** Bangalore has the lowest Average Rating (3.4) compared to Delhi (3.8). This indicates an operational quality issue in Bangalore properties that needs immediate HR/Management intervention.

**3. Booking Channels & Cancellations**
**The Leakage:** The dashboard reveals a 24.84% Cancellation Rate.

**Impact:** Nearly 1 in 4 bookings is cancelled. This disrupts forecasting.

**Recommendation:** Review the cancellation policy. Consider implementing "Non-refundable lower rates" to secure guaranteed revenue.

**💡 Strategic Recommendations**
**Improve Occupancy:** With 57% occupancy, 43% of inventory is perishable (unsold). Launch mid-week flash sales to target the "Standard" and "Premium" room classes.

**Focus on Quality in Bangalore:** Initiate a quality audit for Bangalore properties to improve the 3.4 rating, as reputation directly correlates with future RevPAR.

**Platform Optimization:** Analyze which booking platforms (Filter by Platform) are driving the high cancellation rates and adjust policies for those specific channels.
